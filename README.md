# Requirements

These are the installs needed to reproduce the code in this repository :

pandas==1.3.4

numpy==1.20

plotly==5.3.1

datashader==0.13.0

dash==2.0.0

python==3.8.12

# Getting started

First you will need to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Iuryck/DataSprintsTestCase.git
```

Next, you need to add the data from the test case into the same folder with these code files (Trips data, vendors data, etc). After that, run **Load_Data.py** to load the files and create the **Trips_and_Vendors.db** file, and you're all set! You can run each code according to the tasks it solves. There is also the jupyter notebook that shows better how I got to the solutions of the tasks.
